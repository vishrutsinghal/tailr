| Project Learnings | as required by the plan | selected for this task |
| Learning Refresh Awareness | as required by the plan | selected for this task |

### Required before closure

- **Focused testing and validation:** prove the changed behavior, required preservation cases, and regression boundary with factual computational evidence
- **Canonical completion and closure:** prevent completion while required evidence is missing, unavailable, or failing

## Architecture Analysis

- **Status:** `not selected`. This control is not part of the approved proof boundary for this plan.

## Behaviour Analysis

- **Status:** `not selected`. This control is not part of the approved proof boundary for this plan.

## Focused Validation Coverage Summary

- **Requirements covered:** 3/3.
- **Proof command reuse:**
  - `cmd-dcb44d` covers 3 requirement(s): REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-03.

## Token Estimate

- **Planned working set:** approximately `3328` tokens (confidence: `medium`).
- **Scoped-file ceiling:** approximately `71647` tokens; estimated reduction `95.36%`.
- **Confidence basis:** at least one bounded slice lacks an exact combined behavior-and-symbol anchor.
- This is an estimate from saved scope, not measured model/provider usage.

## Implementation Boundary

- **Editable scope:** `scripts/verbose-reporting.py`.
- **Read-only / proof-only scope:** `scripts/closure-finalizer.py`, `scripts/delivery-record.py`, `scripts/planning_lock.py`, `tests/test_closure_finalizer.py`, `tests/test_start_plan_presentation.py`.
- **Excluded:** every path, command, external system, deployment, and data change not explicitly recorded above remains outside this approval.
- **Data impact:** no data impact is authorized unless a requirement above names it explicitly.

## Approval Checklist

- [x] Requirements are present and reviewable.
- [x] Every requirement has an editable implementation owner.
- [x] Runnable proof commands are registered and mapped to requirements.
- [x] Material questions are resolved.
- [ ] Mandatory planning audit is clean for this exact plan revision.
- [ ] The host has reviewed the scope, preservation criteria, proof commands, analyses, and excluded boundary.
- **Risks to review:** secrets/token

## Review Cycles Summary

| Cycle | Revision | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | v1 | initial review | Start Plan generated and mandatory audit required |

- **Total review cycles:** 1
- **Revision cycles:** 0
- **Latest audit:** not yet recorded. Run the mandatory planning audit before approval.

## Approval Decision

**NOT READY FOR APPROVAL** — resolve or revise: a clean mandatory planning audit.

## Canonical Machine Record

- Machine-readable state remains available at [`.tailtrail/runs/start-20261030120423-5f4593/planning/start-report-v1.json`](.tailtrail/runs/start-20261030120423-5f4593/planning/start-report-v1.json); it is not the approval view.
